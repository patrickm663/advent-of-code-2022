# Advent of Code 2022
This repository serves to track my Advent of Code progress.

I intend to use a variety of programming languages where possible to learn more about them.

## Day One
First attempt used Julia. The run time is 0.06s which is fairly good given 6 year old hardware. It may be worth trying the problem using functional techniques rather than loops.
